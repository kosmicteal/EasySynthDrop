Synthesizer V Studio belongs to Dreamtonics (https://dreamtonics.com/)

## DISCLAIMER
I do not take any liability for any of the forks done from this software; no reverse engineering, disassembly or decompilation was done. 

## About this software
This software reads your SynthV database folder and allows you to drag-and-drop one of your databases (the last version you have installed) into SynthV to create a new track easily. It just reads your folders, creates an empty file and allows you to drop it into the engine so it's safe to use.
As a small note, this is the first software that I've done that has DPI-awareness compatible animations and resizes perfectly depending on your screen.

## How to install it
Just decompress the file into your system. If you see any error about redistributables or it doesn't fully load, remember to install those from Windows themselves.

## How to use it
Click the cog icon (or the Settings one if you will) and select the folder where you have your SynthV banks installed.
